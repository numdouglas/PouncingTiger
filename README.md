# PouncingTiger
My first Game. Endless jumper with great music.
Help Tiger Father cross the chasm and ascend.

## How to install
1. Navigate to app/debug directory
2. Find and download app-debug.apk
3. Install the game from an android 2+ device.You may need to trust unknown sources.

## How to play.
1. Turn the phone left or right to glide left or right.
2. Use the platforms to progressively jump higher.
3. Use springs to give that much needed extra push up.
4. Glide away from anything that moves, a touch could tip off your balance!
<br /><br />Adding to point 4 above, use some "cheats" such as warping off the left right ends of this universe by gliding off them...It's a little complicated you have to play this to see it.:)
